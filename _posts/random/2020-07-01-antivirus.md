## What is antivirus solution?
Antivirus software supports protecting your PC from cyber criminals and malware. Antivirus software looks at data — web pages, files, software and applications via the network. It is searching for known threats and tracking the conduct of all programs, with suspected conduct. The aim is to prevent or remove malware at the earliest possible opportunity.

### What i loves about ESET INTERNET SECURITY:

#### Banking and privacy secured

#### **IoT and webcam Protection**

Test for vulnerabilities on your home router and smart devices. See and block your webcam from any unforeseen access.

#### **Multi-platform protection**

With a single license, protect all your devices. Whether you're running on a Mac , Windows, Android, or Linux – so far, I 'm happy with Windows platform.

#### **Privacy protection**

#### **Anti-theft**

Stay safer by tracking your missing computer and finding it when it gets lost or stolen and identify theft through the built-in camera of your computer.

#### **Minimal power usage**

Without slowdowns to play, work and access the internet. Keep unplugged and enjoy gaming without intrusive pop-ups in battery-saving mode longer. 

- **Small System Footprint**  
Keeps high performance and prolongs hardware life.  Saves bandwidth with very limited upgrade packages on the Internet. I loves the update as it is very lightweight.

## Why you should have antivirus solution?
Given the continually evolving cyber threats, antivirus security is important. You may run the risk of picking up a virus or using other malicious software which can remain undetected and create havoc on the computer and mobile device if you do not have security software installed.

Nowadays, people tend to watch online movies or live streaming football right? Do you know that you may expose to risk by visiting the online streaming website? Do you know that some of them may have been compromised before? Of course, you don't if you are regular computer users but loves to stream online.

Malware attempts to hide in seemingly harmless films such as videos, mp3s, program files, and images. It can be difficult to look at a file if it has hidden malware — this is why it is really important to have a good quality antivirus.

There a few methods used by antivirus scanners to detect malware:

-   **Malware database.** This is the most common method used by built-in virus scanners like Windows Defender and Apple File Quarantine. Malware databases contain thousands of types of known malware, and they’re frequently updated so scanners can identify the newest threats.
-   **Heuristics.** Viruses can be encrypted or altered to deceive malware database tools. Heuristics-based scanners make logical assumptions, analyzing seemingly safe files to unmask encrypted malware.
-   **Sandboxing.** A sandbox is an artificial virtual environment — any files running in a sandbox can’t affect system files outside the sandbox. Any changes that a piece of malware tries to make disappear the moment the sandbox is closed down.
-   **Machine learning.** Behavior analysis and machine learning are the latest threat detection tools, capable of detecting zero-day threats based on the threat’s behavior alone. Only a few of the best antiviruses offer true machine learning in their antivirus engines.

### Computer Protection
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faisalfs10x/faisalfs10x.github.io/master/asset/eset/4.comp%20protection.PNG)
- Computer Protection that has been offered by Eset Internet Security. I love the Host Intrusion Prevention System feature. I have tested the HIPS by scanning the host and I get blocked by the HIPS :pensive:
- Webcam protection is also great. Whenever some applications need access to webcam, EIS with alert us earlier before granting access to the application. Good effort bad guys :joy:!!

### Internet Protection
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faisalfs10x/faisalfs10x.github.io/master/asset/eset/6.%20internet_protection.PNG)

- Decent antivirus solutions must have web access protection, email client protection, antispam protection, and anti-Phishing protection to ensure daily users in a good shape of protection.

### Network Protection
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faisalfs10x/faisalfs10x.github.io/master/asset/eset/7.network%20protection.PNG)

- Network attack protection (IDS) and Botnet protection are very important to me as I'm often dealing with malicious contents :sweat_smile:.
- The IDS have intrusion detection such as SMB, RDP, RPC, ARP poisoning, port scanning protection, and much more with are great for me.

- How EIS monitors my home network and alerts me every time new devices are connected to my network.:sunglasses:

### Security Tool
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faisalfs10x/faisalfs10x.github.io/master/asset/eset/8.security_tool.PNG)

- We always make online transactions right? Hence, the banking and payment protection are good choices to protect our online banking websites and crypto-wallets.
- The anti-theft feature could protect our computer in case of loss or theft. We need to enable this feature and linked to the [Eset cloud service](https://anti-theft.eset.com) in order to make it work.

## Proof of Concept for online streamers

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faisalfs10x/faisalfs10x.github.io/master/asset/eset/11.%20scriptInject.PNG)

- The Eset has found the trojan when you are browsing to malicious online streaming sites. Eset blocked first then alert us before we continue browsing to the malicious site.

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faisalfs10x/faisalfs10x.github.io/master/asset/eset/10.%20Top%20July%20threat.PNG)

- Based on [Virusradar](https://www.virusradar.com/en/statistics), `[HTML/ScrInject](https://www.virusradar.com/en/HTML_ScrInject/detail)`, HTML/ScrInject is the top 3 threat for the month of July 2020 in Malaysia. It is often found in online streaming sites. :cold_sweat:

 - HTML/ScrInject is the detection of a program code that redirects the browser to a specific URL location with malicious software. The program code of the malware is usually embedded in HTML pages which is specified as a trojan.

## Conclusion
