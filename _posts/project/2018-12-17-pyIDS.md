ArtificiaI Intelligence Intruder Detection System based on Face Recognition using OpenCV deep learning.

## Intro:

The system is capable of detecting and recognizing multiple faces in live acquired video.
This project is aimed to design an intelligent intrusion detection system that will be able to
recognize and identify any person and give alarm if the face is not recognized. 

Reading human facial expressions can help us in our day-to-day activities such as security
issues, gaming technology, marketing, and advertising and the expert system.

## Methodology:

i. Image Processing
For detection and recognition of specific characters in complicated images, the project starts with installing OpenCv2 in python environment. First, source image path is added to the process. Image is been transformed from RGB format image value from 0 -255 to Greyscale value by obtaining the average channels color and making each channel equals to the average with the function `cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY`, formula of `x=(R+G+B)/3`. RGB value have to be normalized where:

    X=(R * 0.229 + G * 0.587 + B * 0.114)

After image been convert to greyscale, Template Matching method is been applied with the function `matchedIdxs = [i for (i, b) in enumerate(matches) if b] counts = {}` where the variable ‘matchedIdxs’ is defined by dataset image to be found. This function will compare the template image over the source image under the template image and several comparison methods are implemented. Result return with the value of each pixel hold in source image, then been compare to template image to determine the neighbor of the pixel match. Once get results, function `cv2.minMaxLoc(result)` is used to determine the maximum and minimum values in pixel. The region of the template image are determined. To show the matching region, bounding box are created. Because function are `rgb = imutils.resize(frame, width=400)` method, so we take the maximum where `(left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 255, 0), 2)` for making sure the box is in the matching region. To set the box size, function `cv2.rectangle()` is used where the box output is rectangle and match the matching template. The function `cv2.imshow()` is used to output the final result and show in RGB image together with matching box.
