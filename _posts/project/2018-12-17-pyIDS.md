ArtificiaI Intelligence Intruder Detection System based on Face Recognition using OpenCV deep learning.

## Intro:

The system is capable of detecting and recognizing multiple faces in live acquired video. This project is aimed to design an intelligent intrusion detection system that will be able to recognize and identify any person and give alarm if the face is not recognized. Reading human facial expressions can help us in our day-to-day activities such as security issues, gaming technology, marketing, and advertising and the expert system.

## Methodology:

i. Image Processing

For detection and recognition of specific characters in complicated images, the project starts with installing OpenCv2 in python environment. First, source image path is added to the process. Image is been transformed from RGB format image value from 0 -255 to Greyscale value by obtaining the average channels color and making each channel equals to the average with the function `cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY`, formula of `x=(R+G+B)/3`. RGB value have to be normalized where:

    X=(R * 0.229 + G * 0.587 + B * 0.114)

After image been convert to greyscale, Template Matching method is been applied with the function `matchedIdxs = [i for (i, b) in enumerate(matches) if b] counts = {}` where the variable ‘matchedIdxs’ is defined by dataset image to be found. This function will compare the template image over the source image under the template image and several comparison methods are implemented. Result return with the value of each pixel hold in source image, then been compare to template image to determine the neighbor of the pixel match. Once get results, function `cv2.minMaxLoc(result)` is used to determine the maximum and minimum values in pixel. The region of the template image are determined. To show the matching region, bounding box are created. Because function are `rgb = imutils.resize(frame, width=400)` method, so we take the maximum where `(left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 255, 0), 2)` for making sure the box is in the matching region. To set the box size, function `cv2.rectangle()` is used where the box output is rectangle and match the matching template. The function `cv2.imshow()` is used to output the final result and show in RGB image together with matching box.

ii. Face Recognition 

Face-recognition library are installed in the python environment along with OpenCv2. These library are able to do real-time recognition in live. This task is conducted by using live method which require webcam to capture face. `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` function are used for reference to default webcam. To recognize the face in real-time, deep learning had to be done. Network have to learn to be able recognize the face real-time by using provided dataset. In this project function `face_recognition.load_image_file()` are used to provide dataset for network to learn. In deep learning, dlib face-recognition, the output vector is 128-dimension real-valued numbers that are used to quantify the face. The training method is done using “triplet” which is already in face-recognition library. Function `face_recognition.face_encoding()[] from cv2` enable network to perform deep learning and training. If there is more than 1 face to recognize, the function must be written based on the numbers of face to recognize to enable the network to learn. Array for known face encoding and the names is been created.

Each frame of the video will be looped continuously frame by frame which causes the results output video to be slow because of the limitation of the performance. Next it will compare the source dataset with the video frame and check if it’s match the known face by using function `face_recognition.compare_faces()` . Tolerance will be set for the distance between faces to consider whether it is matches. Lower is more strict. If unrecognized face, it will refer as ‘Intruder’ . After matches found in the known face, the first one will be used. Function `cv2.rectangle()` been declared for bounding box, purpose for draw box around matches face. Label with known face name will be add below the face.
