# HTB - OpenAdmin

![alt text](https://github.com/faisalfs10x/faisalfs10x.github.io/blob/master/asset/htbwriteup/linux/openadmin/intro.png "openadmin intro")
### Recon
    nmap -Pn -sV --script vulners --script-args mincvss=7.0 -p22,80 10.10.10.171

From the nmap scan, there are 2 services, OpenSSH 7.6p1 and Apache httpd 2.4.29.

As usual, we started with dirsearch to brute force site structure including directories and files in websites and we found interesting directory that is `/music`.

However, i found nothing in the `/music` directory until i clicked the login button and then found this page.

On this page, it seem that it has old version of OpenNetAdmin 18.1.1.

Then, we came to searchsploit for the version and got `RCE` bash script.

### Exploit
First, we have to convert the bash script using `dos2unix` and feed the script with URL argument and we got the `www-data shell`.

#### Discover interesting database configuration files that lead to jimmy shell:
In the box, we do some enumeration until we found interesting database configuration file in **/opt/ona/www/local/config** and we get mysql database config file. Noted that for the `db_passwd`. It seems the password is for database but it might be useful for the users. We also discovered some users on the box that are `jimmy` and `joanna`

I decided to try those credential and got a valid credential for jimmy that is **jimmy:n1nj4W4rri0R!** and `su` into jimmy. Hmmm, password reuse again. Then, enumerate again until found `main.php` file. What is it??

It seem like php session that parsing system command and we tried to curl the file and we got id_rsa for joanna :XD. The localhost server was serving on port 52846 that we obtain using `netstat -alnp` command.

#### Cracking id_rsa and recover the key to gain joanna shell:
Again, copied the id_rsa content to local machine into `hash.txt` and tried to crack the key using `john` and we got **bloodninjas** as the key. Yuhuuuu!!

Now, lets SSH into joanna and grab user flag..

### Privilege escalation

To escalate we tried basic enum using `sudo -l` and found that joanna can run `/bin/nano /opt/priv` without any password.

Referring at [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nano/#shell), thereâ€™s a way to execute command which inside nano text editor to escape to root shell.

Then, we can read the root.txt flag on the box after getting privilege as root. XD.
