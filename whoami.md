Hello guys, I'm Faisal Fs who work as Penetration Tester in Malaysia.  

- Definitely a passionate learner.
- Interested in red teaming, ethical hacking and web application hacking.
- Young man who spends his leisure time googling on his computer and doing CTF challenges.
- Love to explore new things and get out of the room.
- Believe me, just doing what I love, and don't what I hate. You can't force me!
